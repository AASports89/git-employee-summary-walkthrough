## Overview
---
**'Git Employee Summary'** is a ```node.js``` command-line application using dynamic JavaScript with a dependency on ```Inquirer v8.2.4``` that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an ```HTML``` webpage that displays summaries for each employee. 
Testing powered by ```Jest``` plays a key role to making code maintainable, with a unit test available for every part to ensure functionality.

This user-friendly and intuitive application will allow users to create a virtual roladex of employee summaries with ease. Lastly, the 'video walkthrough' will serve as a guide to full functionality and application.
